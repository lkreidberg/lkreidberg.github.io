<p><em>Likely no atmosphere on the hot rocky exoplanet LHS 3844b</em> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.573...87K/abstract">Kreidberg et al. 2019 (Nature)</a> <br>
The first characterization of the rocky surface of a terrestrial exoplanet. Spitzer observations of the thermal phase curve of LHS 3844b revealed a large temperature contrast between the dayside and nightside, ruling out the presence of a thick atmosphere. The Bond albedo of the planet is very low, which suggests a dark surface composition similar to the lunar mare or the surface of Mercury.</p>
<p><em>Phase-resolved spectroscopy of an ultra-hot Jupiter</em> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156...17K/abstract">Kreidberg et al. 2018 (AJ)</a> <br>
The first identification of dayside water dissociation in an ultra-hot Jupiter atmosphere.  Phase-resolved spectra from Hubble and Spitzer phase showed strong variation in chemistry and climate between the dayside and nightside. The dayside has an absence of water absorption, and a thermal inversion driven by the extremely high insolation. The nightside transitions to a non-inverted temperature profile, and absoprtion features consistent with the presence CO and water.</p>
<p><em>A precise water abundance measurement for the hot Jupiter WASP-43b</em> <a href="">Kreidberg et al. 2014 (ApJ)</a> <br>
A precise measurement of the water abundance for a hot Jupiter. Compared to the cold temperatures found on Jpiter in the Solar System, high temperature hot Jupiters give a water &ndash; an essential building block for planet formation &ndash; in the gas phase in the upper atmosphere. WASP-43b has a water abundance consistent with the :w</p>

A definitive detection of high-altitude condensates in the atmosphere of a sub-Neptune. Sub-Neptunes have no analogue in the Solar System</p>

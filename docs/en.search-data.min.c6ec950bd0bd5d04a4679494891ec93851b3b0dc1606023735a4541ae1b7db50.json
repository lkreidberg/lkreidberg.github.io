In my work, I focus mainly on transiting planets that periodically pass in front of (and behind) their host stars. For these systems, it is possible to measure the atmospheres\u0026rsquo; chemical composition, cloud properties, and climate. The Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes have been my tools of choice for many years, but I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see observing capability progress by leaps and bounds over the next decade, starting with the James Webb Space Telescope and continuing on to the next generation of ground-based telescopes by the end of the 2020s.\nHighlights # The first characterization of the rocky surface of a terrestrial exoplanet \u0026ndash; Kreidberg et al. 2019 (Nature)\nThe first identification of dayside water dissociation in an ultra-hot Jupiter atmosphere \u0026ndash; Kreidberg et al. 2018 (AJ)\nA precise measurement of the water abundance for a hot Jupiter \u0026ndash; Kreidberg et al. 2014 (ApJL)\nA definitive detection of high-altitude condensates in the atmosphere of a sub-Neptune \u0026ndash; Kreidberg et al. 2014 (Nature)\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/cv/","title":"Vitae","section":"Docs","content":" Vitae # Click for full pdf cv.\nAppointments\nsince 2020: Director, APEx Department, Max Planck Insitute for Astronomy 2019 - 2020: Clay Fellow, Center for Astrophysics | Harvard and Smithsonian 2016 - 2019: Junior Fellow, Society of Fellows, Harvard University 2016 - 2019: ITC Fellow, Center for Astrophysics| Harvard and Smithsonian\nEducation 2011 - 2016: University of Chicago, Ph.D. Astronomy and Astrophysics 2007- 2011: Yale University, B.S.

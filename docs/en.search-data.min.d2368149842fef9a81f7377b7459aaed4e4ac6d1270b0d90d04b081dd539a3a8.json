In my work, I focus mainly on transiting planets that periodically pass in front of (and behind) their host stars. For these systems, it is possible to measure the atmospheres\u0026rsquo; chemical composition, cloud properties, and climate. The Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes have been my tools of choice for many years, but I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see observing capability progress by leaps and bounds over the next decade, starting with the James Webb Space Telescope and continuing on to the next generation of ground-based telescopes by the end of the 2020s.\nHighlights # Likely no atmosphere on the hot rocky exoplanet LHS 3844b Kreidberg et al. 2019 (Nature)\\ The first characterization of the rocky surface of a terrestrial exoplanet. Spitzer observations of the thermal phase curve of LHS 3844b revealed a large temperature contrast between the dayside and nightside, ruling out the presence of a thick atmosphere. The Bond albedo of the planet is very low, which suggests a dark surface composition similar to the lunar mare or the surface of Mercury.\nPhase-resolved spectroscopy of an ultra-hot Jupiter Kreidberg et al. 2018 (AJ)\\ The first identification of dayside water dissociation in an ultra-hot Jupiter atmosphere. Hubble/WFC3 and Spitzer phase curves of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-103b revealed a thermal inversion driven by high insolation on the dayside, transitioning to a non-inverted temperature profile on the nightside.\nA precise water abundance measurement for the hot Jupiter WASP-43b Kreidberg et al. 2014 (ApJ)\\ Hot Jupiters have water in the gas phase!!\nClouds in the atmosphere of the sub-Neptune GJ 1214b Kreidberg et al. 2014 (Nature)\\ A definitive detection of high-altitude condensates in the atmosphere of a sub-Neptune. Sub-Neptunes have no analogue in the Solar System\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/cv/","title":"Vitae","section":"Docs","content":" Vitae # Click for full pdf cv.\nAppointments\nsince 2020: Director, APEx Department, Max Planck Insitute for Astronomy 2019 - 2020: Clay Fellow, Center for Astrophysics | Harvard and Smithsonian 2016 - 2019: Junior Fellow, Society of Fellows, Harvard University 2016 - 2019: ITC Fellow, Center for Astrophysics| Harvard and Smithsonian\nEducation 2011 - 2016: University of Chicago, Ph.D. Astronomy and Astrophysics 2007- 2011: Yale University, B.S.

In my work, I focus mainly on transiting planets that periodically pass in front of (and behind) their host stars. For these systems, it is possible to measure the atmospheres\u0026rsquo; chemical composition, cloud properties, and climate. Most of my work to date has used the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. Observing capability for exoplanet atmospheres is expected to progress by leaps and bounds of the next decade, starting with the James Webb Space Telescope and continuing on to the next generation of ground-based telescopes by the end of the 2020s.\nAt the moment I am particularly interested in the following questions: \\\nUnder what circumstances do rocky exoplanets maintain atmosphers? how prevalent are secondary atmospheres on rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs? What is the bulk composition of sub-Neptunes? What is the 3D structure of hot Jupiter atmospheres? Highlights # Likely no atmosphere on the hot rocky exoplanet LHS 3844b Kreidberg et al. 2019 (Nature)\\ Spitzer observations of the thermal phase curve revealed a large temperature contrast between the planet\u0026rsquo;s dayside and nightside, ruling out the presence of a thick atmosphere. The Bond albedo of the planet is low (\u0026lt;0.2 at 2sigma confidence), which suggests a dark surface composition\nDemographic trends in the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes Crossfield and Kreidberg 2017 (AJ)\\\nPhase-resolved spectroscopy of an ultra-hot Jupiter Crossfield and Kreidberg 2017 (AJ)\\ Hubble/WFC3 and Spitzer phase curves of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-103b\nA precise water abundance measurement for the hot Jupiter WASP-43b Kreidberg et al. 2014 (ApJ)\\ Hot Jupiters have water in the gas phase!!\nClouds in the atmosphere of the sub-Neptune GJ 1214b Kreidberg et al. 2014 (Nature)\\ Sub-Neptunes - no SS analog, possibly extremely water-rich\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/cv/","title":"Vitae","section":"Docs","content":" Vitae # pdf copy\nAppointments\nsince 2020: Director, APEx Department, Max Planck Insitute for Astronomy 2019 - 2020: Clay Fellow, Center for Astrophysics | Harvard and Smithsonian 2016 - 2019: Junior Fellow, Society of Fellows, Harvard University 2016 - 2019: ITC Fellow, Center for Astrophysics| Harvard and Smithsonian\nEducation 2011 - 2016: University of Chicago, Ph.D. Astronomy and Astrophysics 2007- 2011: Yale University, B.S.

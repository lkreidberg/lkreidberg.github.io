# About

Laura Kreidberg is an observational astronomer, exoplanet enthusiast, and director of the [APEx Department](https://www.mpia.de/institute/scientific-departments/atmospheric-physics-of-exoplanets) at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.

Her research focuses primarily on atmosphere characterization of transiting exoplanets.  She is interested in measuring the basic atmospheric properties of planets -- their chemical composition and climate -- to learn how the observed diversity of exoplanets comes to be, how the Solar System fits into the broader context of planetary systems in the universe, and whether there are any other inhabited planets out there.

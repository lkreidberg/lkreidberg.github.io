# Bio

I grew up in beautiful Reno, Nevada, where I acquired a lifelong love for mountains and a distaste for gambling. 

I was an undergraduate at Yale University, followed by a PhD at the University of Chicago. I spent four years in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a Junior Fellow at the [Harvard Society of Fellows](https://socfell.fas.harvard.edu/) and a Clay Fellow at the [Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/).

Outside of work I'm an enthusiastic runner, tango dancer, New Yorker reader

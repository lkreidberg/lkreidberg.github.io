# Research

Now that [over 5000 exoplanets](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/exoplanetplots/exo_dischist_cumulative.png) have been found, including many around bright, nearby stars, it is possible to begin studying their atmospheres in detail. In my work, I focus mainly on transiting planets that periodically pass in front of (and behind) their host stars. For these systems, it is possible to measure the atmospheres' chemical composition, cloud properties, and climate.  The Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes have been my tools of choice for many years, but I'm excited to see observing capability progress by leaps and bounds over the next decade, starting with the James Webb Space Telescope and continuing on to the next generation of ground-based telescopes by the end of the 2020s.


## Highlights 

_Likely no atmosphere on the hot rocky exoplanet LHS 3844b_ [Kreidberg et al. 2019 (Nature)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.573...87K/abstract)\\
The first characterization of the rocky surface of a terrestrial exoplanet. Spitzer observations of the thermal phase curve of LHS 3844b revealed a large temperature contrast between the dayside and nightside, ruling out the presence of a thick atmosphere. The Bond albedo of the planet is very low, which suggests a dark surface composition similar to the lunar mare or the surface of Mercury. 

_Phase-resolved spectroscopy of an ultra-hot Jupiter_ [Kreidberg et al. 2018 (AJ)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156...17K/abstract)\\
The first identification of dayside water dissociation in an ultra-hot Jupiter atmosphere.  Hubble/WFC3 and Spitzer phase curves of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-103b revealed  a  thermal inversion driven by high insolation on the dayside, transitioning to a non-inverted temperature profile on the nightside.

_A precise water abundance measurement for the hot Jupiter WASP-43b_ [Kreidberg et al. 2014 (ApJ)]()\\
Hot Jupiters have water in the gas phase!!

_Clouds in the atmosphere of the sub-Neptune GJ 1214b_ [Kreidberg et al. 2014 (Nature)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Natur.505...69K/abstract)\\
A definitive detection of high-altitude condensates in the atmosphere of a sub-Neptune. Sub-Neptunes have no analogue in the Solar System

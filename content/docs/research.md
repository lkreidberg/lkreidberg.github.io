# Research

Now that [over 5000 exoplanets](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/exoplanetplots/exo_dischist_cumulative.png) have been found, including many around bright, nearby stars, it is possible to begin studying their atmospheres. In my work, I focus mainly on transiting planets that periodically pass in front of (and behind) their host stars. For these systems, it is possible to measure the atmospheres' chemical composition, cloud properties, and climate.  Most of my work to date has used the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. Observing capability for exoplanet atmospheres is expected to progress by leaps and bounds of the next decade, starting with the James Webb Space Telescope and continuing on to the next generation of ground-based telescopes by the end of the 2020s.

At the moment I am particularly interested in the following questions: \
- Under what circumstances do rocky exoplanets maintain atmosphers? how prevalent are secondary atmospheres on rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs?
- What is the bulk composition of sub-Neptunes? 
- What is the 3D structure of hot Jupiter atmospheres?



## Highlights 

_Likely no atmosphere on the hot rocky exoplanet LHS 3844b_ [Kreidberg et al. 2019 (Nature)]()\\
Spitzer observations of the thermal phase curve revealed a large temperature contrast between the planet's dayside and nightside, ruling out the presence of a thick atmosphere. The Bond albedo of the planet is low (<0.2 at 2sigma confidence), which suggests a dark surface composition


_Demographic trends in the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes_ [Crossfield and Kreidberg 2017 (AJ)]()\\

_Phase-resolved spectroscopy of an ultra-hot Jupiter_ [Crossfield and Kreidberg 2017 (AJ)]()\\
Hubble/WFC3 and Spitzer phase curves of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-103b 

_A precise water abundance measurement for the hot Jupiter WASP-43b_ [Kreidberg et al. 2014 (ApJ)]()\\
Hot Jupiters have water in the gas phase!!

_Clouds in the atmosphere of the sub-Neptune GJ 1214b_ [Kreidberg et al. 2014 (Nature)]()\\
Sub-Neptunes - no SS analog, possibly extremely water-rich

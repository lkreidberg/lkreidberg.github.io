# Code
I'm an enthusiastic advocate for open-source software.  Below are several projects I've been closely involved in. 

## Data Reduction 

[Eureka!](https://eurekadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | an end-to-end JWST data reduction and analysis pipeline

[pacman](https://pacmandocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | an end-to-end HST/WFC3 data reduction and analysis pipeline 

## Light Curve Models

[batman](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~lkreidberg/batman/) | fast transit light curve models ([Kreidberg 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PASP..127.1161K/abstract)) 

[spiderman](https://spiderman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | phase curve models for any planet brightness map ([Louden \& Kreidberg 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.477.2613L/abstract))
